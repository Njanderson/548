# Ariane

## Download and build

* Run `make target=ariane`

Ariane is a 6-stage, single issue, in-order CPU which implements the 64-bit
RISC-V instruction set. The goal of this step is to download the
RTL-implementation and generate a binary for simulation.

## Test

See [Compile and run c code on Ariane](c.md)
