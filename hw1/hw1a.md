# Ariane Scavenger Hunt

The goal of this homework is getting familiar with Ariane by going through the code

## Tips for the homework

* You will get a question about a microarchitectural feature of the processor
* Your answer will consist in the following two items:
    * Your answer in plain text
    * The line-number or code-block backing up your answer, for example:
        * Does the processor has an instruction cache?
            * Yes, [code](https://github.com/pulp-platform/ariane/blob/master/src/ariane.sv#L653) (this would be a line-number example)
        * What performance events related to the L1-cache are supported?
            * i-cache miss and d-cache miss [code](https://github.com/pulp-platform/ariane/blob/master/src/perf_counters.sv#L32-L33) (this would be a code-block example)
* You will submit a pdf file containing the questions and answers as shown here
* You will create the pdf with google-docs and use the link feature described [here](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/45893?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en)
* Where are the implementation files for the processor?
    * [Source](https://github.com/pulp-platform/ariane/tree/master/src)
    * [Include](https://github.com/pulp-platform/ariane/tree/master/include)
